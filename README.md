## Workshop on Open-Source Generative AI




OSGAI is an NSF sponsored workshop that  will bring together technical leaders in open-source AI and research with the goal of defining and addressing core challenges of Generative AI. The focus will be on the technical issues that are specific to open AI systems, with the goal of targeting and defining impactful areas for study that are currently not being address in academic venues. These include: 

* How can we improve approaches that facilitate adaptation of AI for a broader range of users
and use-cases?
* How can we further develop an open ecosystem for open data curation and human feedback
on generative AI?
* How can develop evaluations to allow value-driven open-source organizations ensure ethical,
safe, and accurate systems?
* How can we create tooling to allow open-source organizations to build AI models in a decentralized manner?


## Details

The workshop will be a small group of researchers and developers interested in defining the future challenges of open-source generative AI. 


The event will be hosted at Cornell Tech in New York City on March 25-26, 2024. Two-nights of lodging and travel for participants will be supported by the workshop. 

## Schedule

The workshop will consist of two full days of invited talks and discussions. The full schedule will be posted after attendance is confirmed.
